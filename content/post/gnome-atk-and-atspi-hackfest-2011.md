Every year, the GNOME Accessibility Team tries to have at least one Hackfest.
This year we had an [ATK and AT-SPI hackfest](https://live.gnome.org/Hackfests/ATK2011/)
hosted by [Igalia](http://www.igalia.es) in their offices where we talked about
the future of ATK and identified next goals and actions.

Thanks to my current company, [Emergya](http://www.emergya.es), for funding my
colleague [Javi](https://javierha.wordpress.com/) and me.

## What did we do?
